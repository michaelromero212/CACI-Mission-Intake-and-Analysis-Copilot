ANALYST NOTES - Project Phoenix Technical Review
Date: January 24, 2024
Analyst: Jennifer Martinez, Senior Technical Analyst

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Following the technical review meeting with the client stakeholders, several critical observations and action items have emerged that require immediate attention from the project team.

KEY OBSERVATIONS

1. Data Migration Complexity
The legacy system contains approximately 15 years of historical data spanning multiple database schemas. Initial assessment suggests the migration effort was underestimated by approximately 40%. The custom data transformation rules are more complex than anticipated, particularly for the financial reconciliation modules.

2. Integration Dependencies
The project has identified 23 external system integrations, of which 8 are with legacy mainframe systems using proprietary protocols. Three of these systems are scheduled for decommissioning in Q3 2024, which creates a tight timeline dependency.

3. Security Requirements
New DoD security requirements (CMMC Level 2) must be implemented before the Phase 2 deployment. This adds an estimated 6-8 weeks to the security certification timeline. The team needs to engage with the security assessment vendor immediately.

4. Stakeholder Alignment
There appears to be misalignment between the operations team and the IT governance board regarding the deployment approach. Operations prefers a phased rollout, while IT governance is pushing for a big-bang approach to minimize transition period risks.

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

Priority 1 (This Week):
- Schedule data migration deep-dive session with legacy system SMEs
- Request updated interface specifications from mainframe team
- Initiate CMMC assessment vendor engagement

Priority 2 (Within 2 Weeks):
- Conduct stakeholder alignment workshop
- Update project schedule to reflect revised estimates
- Review and update risk register

Priority 3 (Within 1 Month):
- Complete proof-of-concept for critical integrations
- Finalize training curriculum
- Establish post-go-live support model

CONCERNS
The current timeline does not adequately account for the complexity uncovered during this review. A formal schedule re-baseline should be considered before proceeding with the next phase gate.
