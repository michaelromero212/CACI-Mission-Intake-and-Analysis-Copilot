Classification: UNCLASSIFIED // FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY
Date: December 28, 2024
Report ID: CTI-2024-1228-001

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report provides an analysis of emerging cyber threats targeting U.S. defense industrial base (DIB) organizations. Over the past 30 days, our threat intelligence operations have identified a significant increase in spear-phishing campaigns attributed to APT groups with suspected nation-state backing.

THREAT ACTOR PROFILE

Actor Designation: PHANTOM EAGLE
Attribution Confidence: HIGH
Suspected Origin: Eastern Europe
Primary Objectives:
- Intellectual property theft
- Supply chain compromise
- Long-term persistent access

RECENT ACTIVITY

Between December 1-27, 2024, PHANTOM EAGLE conducted 47 documented intrusion attempts against DIB contractors. Notable tactics include:

1. Credential Harvesting: Fake Microsoft 365 login pages hosted on compromised legitimate domains
2. Malware Delivery: ISO files containing LNK shortcuts that execute PowerShell loaders
3. C2 Infrastructure: Use of Cloudflare Workers for command-and-control communications

INDICATORS OF COMPROMISE (IOCs)

Domains:
- login-microsoftonline[.]com
- sharepoint-auth[.]net
- azure-security-update[.]com

IP Addresses:
- 185.234.xxx.xxx (C2 server - Germany)
- 91.195.xxx.xxx (Staging server - Netherlands)

File Hashes (SHA-256):
- a3b8c9d4e5f6... (PowerShell loader)
- 7f8e9d0c1b2a... (Cobalt Strike beacon)

RECOMMENDED MITIGATIONS

1. Implement phishing-resistant MFA across all user accounts
2. Block ISO, LNK, and VBS attachments at email gateway
3. Deploy EDR solutions with behavioral detection capabilities
4. Conduct security awareness training focused on spear-phishing
5. Monitor for connections to known C2 infrastructure

RISK ASSESSMENT

Current threat level for DIB organizations: HIGH

The sophistication and persistence of PHANTOM EAGLE operations indicate a well-resourced threat actor with strategic objectives aligned with foreign intelligence priorities.

NEXT STEPS

- Continue monitoring for new TTPs and infrastructure
- Coordinate with CISA and FBI on threat intelligence sharing
- Update detection rules and hunting queries weekly
