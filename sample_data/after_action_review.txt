AFTER ACTION REVIEW (AAR)
Operation: DESERT FALCON
Date of Operation: December 15-18, 2024
Location: [REDACTED], Southwest Region
Classification: UNCLASSIFIED

OPERATION OVERVIEW

Operation DESERT FALCON was a joint training exercise designed to test interoperability between ground forces and intelligence support elements. The exercise involved 340 personnel across three military branches and two intelligence agencies.

PARTICIPANTS

Lead Element: 3rd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment
Supporting Elements:
- 112th Military Intelligence Brigade (Analysis Cell)
- Air National Guard 163rd Attack Wing (ISR Support)
- Defense Intelligence Agency Liaison Team
- National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Field Representatives

OBJECTIVES

1. Validate real-time intelligence fusion procedures
2. Test secure communications protocols in degraded environments
3. Exercise targeting cycle time reduction initiatives
4. Assess human-machine teaming concepts

WHAT WENT WELL

Intelligence Fusion: The Multi-Domain Operations Cell successfully integrated SIGINT, GEOINT, and HUMINT feeds into a common operating picture within 15 minutes of collection, exceeding the 30-minute target.

Communications: The new Tactical Data Links performed exceptionally well, maintaining 98.7% uptime despite electronic warfare interference from the opposing force.

Targeting: Find-Fix-Finish cycle times averaged 12 minutes, a 40% improvement over the previous exercise.

Leadership: Command and control was decisive and effective, with clear delegation of authorities.

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

Logistics: Fuel resupply to forward positions was delayed by 4 hours due to route miscommunication.

Interoperability: Some legacy equipment from partner units was incompatible with our tactical network, requiring manual workarounds.

Training Gaps: 23% of participants had not completed the required pre-exercise online modules, causing delays in initial briefings.

Battle Damage Assessment: BDA reporting was inconsistent, with some units using outdated formats.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Conduct a logistics planning conference 72 hours prior to future operations
2. Establish an equipment compatibility matrix for all participating units
3. Enforce pre-exercise training completion as a condition of participation
4. Standardize BDA reporting templates across all elements
5. Increase frequency of similar exercises from quarterly to bi-monthly

LESSONS LEARNED

1. Real-time intelligence fusion significantly reduces decision cycle times
2. Investment in modern communications infrastructure pays dividends
3. Human-machine teaming requires more training than initially anticipated
4. Interoperability challenges are solvable with advance coordination

CONCLUSION

Operation DESERT FALCON achieved its primary objectives and provided valuable insights for future multi-domain operations. The integration of advanced intelligence capabilities with ground forces demonstrated significant potential for operational effectiveness.
